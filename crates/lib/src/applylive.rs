//! # Live application of staged content
//!
//! This module implements `bootc apply-live`, which makes content from the
//! staged deployment visible on the running system without a reboot.
//! See <https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc/issues/76>.
//!
//! The only scope supported today is logically bound images
//! (`bootc apply-live bound-images`). The image bytes are already shared
//! between deployments via the bootc-owned container storage; what is
//! pinned to a deployment is only the *definition*: the symlink in
//! `/usr/lib/bootc/bound-images.d` and the quadlet file it references.
//!
//! On the ostree backend, that shared container storage is just a plain
//! directory, so applying a definition change live does not require
//! mounting anything new -- podman already reads the same storage the
//! booted and staged deployments share. (The composefs backend lays out
//! storage differently and is not handled here yet.) Changed quadlet files
//! are written to `/run/containers/systemd/`, which podman gives
//! precedence over `/etc` and `/usr`, and the affected units are restarted.
//! Because `/run` is transient, the override disappears on the next boot,
//! at which point the staged deployment's own `/usr` content applies and
//! the system converges without any further action. (A soft reboot
//! preserves `/run`, so the override is explicitly cleared when one is
//! prepared.)
//!
//! Rather than a separate state file, each quadlet written to
//! `/run/containers/systemd/` carries its own state as a leading comment
//! (see [`marker_line`]): the staged checksum, the image reference and
//! whether its unit still needs restarting ("pending"). Units that have no
//! such override to carry their state -- old units to stop after a
//! removal or a `ServiceName=` rename, and units reverting to the booted
//! definition when a stale override is removed -- are recorded in two
//! small flat lists under `/run/bootc/apply-live/` (see [`UnitActions`]),
//! written before `/run/containers/systemd/` changes. Re-running the
//! command re-derives everything from that directory (see
//! [`scan_live_quadlets`]) plus those lists, so a failure part way through
//! -- including a failed stop -- is safe to resume from.
//! Garbage-collection protection for bound images with no quadlet override
//! (unchanged definitions) lives in the same directory; see
//! [`write_protected_images`]. Once every definition is written, the
//! staged checksum is recorded there too (see [`APPLIED_CHECKSUM`]); only
//! then may a re-run skip straight to the pending unit operations.
